## Project: **Collab**

## Description: Foster trustless collaboration between skilled individuals

### Problem

It is much easier to verify skills and abilities of an individual but very difficult to understand their character. Can you collaborate with those whom you cannot trust? You can now, **Collab** aims to foster trustless collaborations amongst strangers by making earning distribution trustless using Smart Contracts on Cardano. You just need to ~~trust~~ verify the contract logic (which is difficult but still easier than understanding humans) and you can go find and collaborate with any person or group who fit the project's needs.
